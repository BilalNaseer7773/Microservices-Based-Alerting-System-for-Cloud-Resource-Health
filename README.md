# Microservices-Based-Alerting-System-for-Cloud-Resource-Health


Developed an alerting system to monitor the health and performance of cloud resources within a microservices architecture. Used AWS CloudWatch and Lambda to continuously monitor metrics like CPU usage, memory, and network traffic. When thresholds were exceeded, the system triggered automated alerts via SNS (Simple Notification Service) to notify the DevOps team. Configured Terraform to handle infrastructure-as-code, enabling automated and consistent environment setup. Implemented data storage in an AWS S3-based data lake, storing historical data for trend analysis and reporting.
